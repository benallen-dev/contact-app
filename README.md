# Contact.App

The contacts app from Hypermedia Systems

Currently building out the Web 1.0 application in Go, but not done yet. In fact, I'm at this point:

[https://hypermedia.systems/a-web-1-0-application/#:~:text=software%20update%20required.-,Handling%20the%20post%20to%20/contacts/new,-The%20next%20step](https://hypermedia.systems/a-web-1-0-application/#:~:text=software%20update%20required.-,Handling%20the%20post%20to%20/contacts/new,-The%20next%20step)

Once that's done I'll tag the 1.0 commit and start adding the HTMX features.

## BTW

The structure of this program is pretty terrible with how things depend on each other but 
writing a nicely-factored application wasn't exactly the goal here
